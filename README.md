Retailer Management System
The application supports the following actions:

1. Every customer registers an account with an email and will be assigned an ID for the frequent-shopper program. For simplifying the case, similar to CostcoMembership, every customer has to register an account before purchasing the products in store (skip the online store in this project).

2. A customer holding an account can register/modify/delete credit cards and addresses
for their account in store.

3. A customer can check out his/her order in store.

4. Employees can check and update the products/stock information. Update happens
when products are sold to the store by the vendor(s).

5. When new stock is added to a store, the system checks that if the total size of all
products stored in this store exceeds the size of the store (warehouse).
